Flexi-Credit-System
===================
This project is a simple Time Table Chooser application implemented in all
Universities affiliated with the Flexi-Credit System. A Flexi-Credit system
enables students to register for and complete courses and electives of their
interest to hit the minimum credit number required of them.
Certification for a course is awarded by transalating the required number of
instruction hours attended by the student per week into credits . The
minimum number of credits to be earned are mentioned so that students
select subjects in such a way that the requirement is met.
There are a fixed number of mandatory courses under each discipline of
study. The student is given the choice to undertake additional courses and
gain more number of credits. Once the desired courses are selected, a
timetable is generated. A clash in the periods is avoided by segragating
dissimilar courses together in slots.
This bridges the gap between professional and liberal education hence
providing students with an academically rich education system.
